*The goal is to emulate aircraft systems
*Each campus is assigned red/blue team

9/15/2021
*Follow-up meeting with Brian Jaury from Boeing
*Using QEMU for emulation
	- I am more familiar with VirtualBox and VMware, so this will be a challenge

*Asked if we could use VirtualBox, but Brian preferred QEMU

9/27/2021
*Because we are conducting penetration testing, it is important that the VMs are in an isolated network
