Main topic: Encryption and cryptography
Partner: Jorge Santos
Basic objectives: Need to create a CTF game that will be played at the end of the semester by the Prescott campus.
	The functionality of this CTF game is to have a system in which it hides keys that are supposed to be found/cracked by the opposition team.
	Enemy needs to find the keys using encryption and cryptography techniques.
	
TO-Do: Coordinate with Jorge Santos to furthermore go in detail with this approach and determine which techniques we would like to apply to do CTF game.

	Need to write or develop a program that encrypts and decrypts data functions that are being tried by the other team.

	Complexity needs to be advanced but able to allow the Prescott team to hack the algorithm to obtain the keys.

	Need to coordinate with Jorge to develop a map that has a timeline of what will be done for the remaining sprints.

	More research for myself in the crypto and encryption field and see what techniques will be best.
